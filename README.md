MWCalculator
============

A calculator for the optimal buildings to buy in the mobile game, Monster Warlord

Input the current number of each type of building owned, and your amount of gold you want to spend in the first column, and
click the Calculate button. It will output the optimal number of buildings to have of each type that you can buy with
the given amount of gold. Optimal means it will maximize the income.

Click the save button to save this newly calculated number of buildings to have, and then click load in the future to prevent
having to input all your building numbers again. You'll only have to input the gold you want to spend.

My motivation for writing this program was because I wanted to buy buildings in the game more optimally, and it
became very tedious to do by hand. Now I just input the gold I want to spend, click Calculate, and buy what it tells me
to buy, super easy!

Future improvements:
- Optimize the calculating algorithm, it's quite inefficient
- Generalize or refactor
- Additional functionality for common Monster Warlord tasks
